There's a we'll election lose in the end, we gotta do something

Gamejam's concept was "Let the bad guys win" so we covered a character who
would normally lose the election trying to win the election with some tricks and
incentives. The strongest part of the game was the meaningful selection of all
gameplay elements in the game.
